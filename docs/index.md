# MIRMEX

Mirmex is a high‐performance tool for the computation of ambient seismic noise
correlations on CPU and GPU clusters. This is intended to address emerging
challenges in noise correlation studies with increasingly large data volumes.
Mirmex implements a parallelization scheme and strategies to efficiently harness
modern supercomputing resources, and shows that the use of GPUs can accelerate
the computation of noise correlations by one order of magnitude or more compared
with a homogeneous implementation on CPUs. In addition to reducing wall‐clock
time, Mirmex enables on‐the‐fly computations of large noise correlation datasets,
thereby eliminating the need for mass storage to archive results.
